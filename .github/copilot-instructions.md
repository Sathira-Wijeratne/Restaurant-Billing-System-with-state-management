## General Principles for 'Ask' chat mode
- Code suggested should follow best practices.
- Whenever possible, the code being suggested should be alligning with the practises used by the industry.
- Avoid providing responses about explanations excessively long, try to keep them concise.
- When explaining concepts, try to explain them simply.
- When I ask theory/explanation based questions, do not jump at giving a code as a response, instead answer the question and then ask whether I want to see the code. 
- When I ask 'yes' or 'no' questions which require an explaination, start off by first answering it with 'yes' or 'no' and then proceed to explain why it is so.
- When suggesting code, if part of the suggested code is the same as what is already existing, it is ok to reference it as "existing code" and then suggest only the new code rather than resuggesting code that is already there.
